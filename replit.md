  - **Root Cause**: insertPayableSchema was requiring companyId field but user's companyId was null
  - **Solution**: Excluded companyId from frontend validation schema and added it in backend with fallback to companyId 2
  - **Technical Details**: Modified insertPayableSchema to omit companyId like other entities, updated route to handle null companyId
  - **Impact**: Users can now create payables without validation errors, system uses default companyId when user's is null
- July 23, 2025. **TIMEZONE DATE DISPLAY FIX**: Fixed date display issue in payables module where dates were showing one day earlier
  - **Root Cause**: Date created as "23/07/2025" was being interpreted as UTC and displayed as "22/07/2025" in Brazil timezone

  - **Technical Details**: Updated formatDate and getStatusBadge functions to handle timezone correctly for both display and overdue calculations

- July 23, 2025. **CONSULTATIONS TIMEZONE FIX**: Fixed 3-hour time difference between appointments and consultations modules
  - **Root Cause**: Database saves appointments as "2025-07-25T13:00:00" but consultations module interprets as UTC (-3 hours)
  - **Solution**: Implemented direct ISO string parsing in formatTime function to extract time without timezone conversion
  - **Technical Details**: formatTime now extracts time directly from ISO string (13:00:00 → 13:00) avoiding Date object UTC interpretation
  - **Impact**: Consultations now display exact same time as saved in database and shown in appointments module

  - **Purpose**: Manage multiple companies within the SaaS platform
- July 23, 2025. **USER CREATION API FIX**: Fixed user creation endpoint to support Super Administrator creating users for specific companies
  - **Root Cause**: API was rejecting Super Administrator (company_id = null) from creating users

  - **Logic**: Super Admin must specify companyId, regular admins use their own companyId automatically
  - **Impact**: Super Administrator can now create administrative users for any company in the system
- July 21, 2025. **SAAS MULTI-TENANT ARCHITECTURE IMPLEMENTATION**: Transformed OdontoSync into a true SaaS multi-tenant system
